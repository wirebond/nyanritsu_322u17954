## Goals

Reverse-engeneer and document Nyanritsu 322U17954 RF Base(board) in order to play with Intel Stratix 10 and Xilinx MPSoC FPGAs, as well with multi-gigabit JESD204B ADC and DAC.

## Origins

Unknown at the moment; most likely, it was a part of Nyanritsu's 4G test & measurement equipment that went into recycling for some reason.
Was bougth on Ebay from an e-waste company for ~200USD.

## Main components

- Intel Stratix 10 FPGA (1SG280LU3F50E3XG, 2.75M LEs)
- Xilinx UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA (XCZU9EG, 700K system logic cells, quad Cortex-A53, dual Cortex-R5F)
- 2x DDR3 SO-DIMM slots for S10
- 1x DDR3 SO-DIMM slot for MPSoC
- 4x SAMTEC Firefly connectors
- 2x AD9162 16b 12GSPS JESD204B DAC
- 1x AD9208 14b 3GSPS JESD204B ADC
- Marvel 88E1111 Gigabit PHY
- Fairly sophisticated RF section

## External I/O

- 4 SAMTEC Firefly PCB connectors (12x configuration); 2x Firefly 12x optics modules are typically included with each board (with fiber ribbon cut really short)
- Erni 973028 (`X3`, `"ZD"`) backplane connector (for unknown number of XCVR lanes)
- TE 1-1746992-1 (`X2`, `"HM"`) backplane connector (at least for GigE, external clocks, control)
- SAMTEC Q Strip series (possibly, QSH-060-01-F-D) (`X23`, `"Debug"`) 120-pin debug connector
- 2x (unknown type) "RF mezzanine connectors" (as described by the seller), typically broken, labelled as `"RF{1,2}_INT"`
- 2x (unknown type) 20-pin I/O connectors, labelled as `"RF{1,2}_EXT"`

## Powering up

The board is powered from a two +12V DC sources - `+12VD` and `+12VA` via main power connector `"UPM"` (TE 5646955-2).
You can supply the 12V power from a single source by soldering wires to `+12VD` (`X58`), `+12VA` (`X57`) and `GND` (`X56`) SMD test terminals on the bottom side, near the power connector.

The powering-up and rail sequencing procedure is controlled by Linear LTC2977 controller (`D9`, also referred as PSM; bottom side, near backplane connectors). It's powered from a standby rails and won't power up the board, unless there's a 3V3 enable signal coming from the chassis via `"UPM"` connector.
You can connect `+3.3_PSM` rail (one of the `C1613` terminals, or from `LND246` testpoint) to the enable signal (`A20` pin on `X2` connector).

The board also have `X18` (`"PSM"`) connector to hook up DC1613 USB-to-I2C/SMBus/PMBus Controller from Linear.

## JTAG connectors

For Stratix 10 use `X21` (`"FPGA_JTAG"`) connector.<br/>
For MPSoC use `X19` (`"PS_JTAG"`) connector. By default, the board is set up to boot MPSoC from the MicroSD card, which is typically not present. You can switch MPSoC boot mode to JTAG using `S1` (`"PS_MODE"`) switch.
